## 🎮 Game Description

**Flashlight Fear** is a browser-based interactive horror game inspired by 80s slasher films. You arrive at an abandoned warehouse with only a flashlight, a growing sense of dread, and no memory of how you got there. Navigate through pitch-black corridors, make life-or-death choices, and collect items to increase your odds of survival.

This game was born out of a love for classic horror and a desire to bring cinematic storytelling to the browser. The goal was to explore how simple tools—JavaScript, CSS, and HTML—could create immersive tension through interactivity, visuals, and branching storylines.
